# What's this?
Hello everyone, I am Wei. Welcome to my website.

I made this website to test the difference among classification algorithms by visulizing their classifiers.

By doing so, we should be able to learn more of the pros and cons about these algorithms.

## Who are you?
I am Wei Chen, a software engineer/scientist from Taiwan.

I did machine learning research in Stanford (USA) and RIKEN (Japan), after graduated from National Taiwan University.

Currently, I joined Groundhog Technologies as the tech lead in New Product Development Team.

## Why machine learning in JavaScript?
I know machine learning in JavaScript will have performance issue.

However, JavaScript can be visualized easily.

Since the project is about visualizing classifiers, this language become our final choice.

btw, my favorite programming language is Scala though.

## Why I clicked something but there's nothing inside?
You probably clicked some stuff that are not ready yet.

Some options and pages exist to remind me what to do next.
